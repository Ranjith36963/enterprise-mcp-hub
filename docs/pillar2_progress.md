# Pillar 2 Progress Log

Mirrors the Pillar 1 format. One section per batch in the execution order fixed
by `docs/pillar2_implementation_plan.md` §7 (2.2 → 2.1 → 2.3 → 2.4 → 2.5 → 2.9 →
2.6 → 2.7 → 2.8 → 2.10).

Generator worktree: `C:\Users\Ranjith\OneDrive\Documents\job360\.claude\worktrees\generator` on branch `worktree-generator` rebased onto local `main @ cdf6aaf`.

## Environment note — pre-existing test hang on `tests/test_sources.py`

Under Python 3.13 on Windows the 81 tests in `tests/test_sources.py` hang
indefinitely inside asyncio's Windows IOCP selector (`_overlapped.GetQueuedCompletionStatus`)
even with `pytest-timeout`. This predates Pillar 2 work (the same hang reproduces
against baseline `1730bf6`, and was flagged in `memory/project_test_http_leak.md`
under a slightly different guise — "JobSpy hits live Indeed"). It does **not**
block Pillar 2 batches because:

1. Every Pillar 2 batch touches the scoring / enrichment / retrieval layers,
   none of which are imported by `test_sources.py`.
2. The source tests are mocked with `aioresponses` — the hang is in the Python
   3.13 × Windows IOCP × aiohttp-shutdown interaction, not in any production
   code path.

Going forward each batch runs:

```bash
# Broad clean baseline (68x passing, no failures)
python -m pytest tests/ \
  --ignore=tests/test_main.py \
  --ignore=tests/test_sources.py \
  -p no:randomly --timeout=10

# Scoped verification for scoring-adjacent batches (2.2, 2.3, 2.9)
python -m pytest tests/test_scorer.py tests/test_profile.py -p no:randomly
```

`test_main.py` is also excluded per the established Pillar-3 pattern (live HTTP
leak in JobSpy against Indeed/Glassdoor).

## Batch 2.2 — Gate-pass scoring — MERGED

**Merged:** `aa13554` on 2026-04-21

**Plan coverage:**
- Plan §4 Batch 2.2 — gate-pass scoring
- Report item(s): #2 (gate-pass eliminates false positives)

**Touches:**
- `backend/src/core/settings.py`: +11 lines (added `MIN_TITLE_GATE` and
  `MIN_SKILL_GATE` as `float(os.getenv(...))` constants defaulting to `0.15`,
  with a comment block explaining the gate semantics).
- `backend/src/services/skill_matcher.py`: +18 lines
  - widened the `src.core.settings` import to pull in the two new constants,
  - added module-level `_gate_suppressed_score(title_pts, skill_pts) -> int | None`
    which returns `max(10, int((title_pts+skill_pts)*0.25))` when either gate
    fails, else `None`,
  - called it from `score_job()` (legacy module-level path) and from
    `JobScorer.score()` (dynamic path) before the linear accumulation of
    location / recency / penalties, so gate-fail jobs cannot be inflated by
    those components.
- `backend/tests/test_scorer.py`: +192 / -24 lines
  - added `TestGatePass` class with 12 gate-aware tests (8 on `JobScorer`,
    4 on the module-level `score_job` path),
  - rewrote 7 pre-existing tests (`test_title_match_contributes_points`,
    `test_location_match_contributes_points`, `test_remote_location_gets_points`,
    `test_more_skills_higher_score`, `test_recency_today_gets_full_points`,
    `test_us_ai_job_scores_lower_than_uk`, `test_score_job_uses_recency_for_job_helper`)
    to use `JobScorer` with a gate-clearing `SearchConfig`. Their original
    invariants (UK > US, today > old, many-skills > few-skills, honest >
    fabricated) are preserved but observable only on the non-suppressed
    linear path — which is Batch 2.2's explicit intent.

**Tests added:** `tests/test_scorer.py` TestGatePass (+12 tests).

**Test delta (scoped to scoring + profile):** 110p → 122p (0 failures, 0 skips).

**Test delta (broad, minus `test_main` / `test_sources`):** 633p/3s → 645p/3s
(+12). No pre-existing test regressed.

**API + IDOR tests (separate run):** 37p / 0f / 0s (unchanged by this batch).

**Deferred from this batch:**
- None. The batch landed exactly as the plan's Touches / Test surface sections
  specified. User-configurable gates (per-profile tuning) are correctly
  deferred to Batch 2.9 per the plan's "Out of scope".

**Post-merge notes:**
- The 7 existing-test rewrites are a direct consequence of the gate's
  semantic intent: without a profile, location/recency alone can no longer
  distinguish jobs, and the old tests encoded the pre-gate bug. Each rewrite
  preserves the original invariant on the JobScorer path where the gate
  passes. This is not scope creep — it is the test-surface evolution named
  in the plan ("Test surface: tests/test_scorer.py — new class TestGatePass").
- `test_score_job_with_patched_keywords_can_pass_gate` uses `monkeypatch` to
  inject non-empty `JOB_TITLES` / `PRIMARY_SKILLS` so the module-level path
  can demonstrate gate-pass. This is the only path inside `score_job()` that
  is observable as non-suppressed under the current (empty-defaults) keyword
  policy.
- Both constants are env-overridable (`MIN_TITLE_GATE=0.10` / `MIN_SKILL_GATE=0.20`
  etc.) so ops can retune without code edits if the 15 % default ever proves
  too aggressive.
- The per-component gate thresholds are absolute, not fractions of the
  user's weighted max. If a future batch introduces user-configurable weights
  (e.g. raising `TITLE_WEIGHT` to 60) the 0.15 fraction would scale with it,
  preserving the intended "15 % of component max" meaning.

## Batch 2.1 — Date confidence correction for signal-less sources — MERGED

**Merged:** <pending commit> on 2026-04-21

**Plan coverage:**
- Plan §4 Batch 2.1
- Report item(s): #1 (date accuracy — narrowed scope per 2026-04-20 verification)

**Touches:**
- `backend/src/sources/scrapers/linkedin.py:69`: `date_confidence="low"` → `"fabricated"`
- `backend/src/sources/ats/workable.py:48`: `date_confidence="low"` → `"fabricated"`
- `backend/src/sources/ats/personio.py:85`: `date_confidence="low"` → `"fabricated"`
- `backend/src/sources/ats/pinpoint.py:56`: `date_confidence="low"` → `"fabricated"`
- `backend/src/services/skill_matcher.py`: **no code change** — the
  `recency_score_for_job()` "fabricated" branch already returns 0 (shipped
  in Pillar 3 Batch 1). A regression test was added instead (plan §4 Batch
  2.1 — "Add a regression test if missing").

**Tests added:**
- **New file** `backend/tests/test_source_date_confidence_labels.py` (+8 tests):
  - 4 parametrized tests asserting linkedin/workable/personio/pinpoint emit
    `date_confidence="fabricated"` — and NOT `"low"` — as literal string
    assignments in source files (static grep, no HTTP).
  - 3 parametrized tests asserting nhs_jobs/jooble/greenhouse continue to
    emit `"low"` (the plan's "wrong-field" category, already correct).
  - 1 wiring test asserting `recency_score_for_job()` returns 0 when
    `date_confidence="fabricated"` — the mechanism that turns the label
    change into a visible score penalty downstream.

**Test delta (scoped: scorer + profile + date schema + new labels file):** 135p → 143p (+8 new).

**Test delta (broad, minus `test_main` + `test_sources`):** 682p/3s → 690p/3s (+8).

**Deferred from this batch:**
- Removing the legacy `date_found` column entirely — kept per plan's
  "Out of scope" (defer until frontend/CLI audit).
- The 5-column schema evolution — already shipped in Pillar 3 Batch 1.
- Ghost-detection machine — already shipped in Pillar 3 Batch 1.

**Post-merge notes:**
- Static-grep tests (`test_source_date_confidence_labels.py`) were preferred
  over parametrizing `tests/test_sources.py` because the latter hits the
  pre-existing Windows × Py3.13 × aioresponses IOCP hang documented at the
  top of this file. The static check polices the *label* a source emits,
  which is the correct scope for Batch 2.1 — we are not testing source
  behaviour, only that the instrumented literal is correct.
- These 4 sources still stamp `date_found=datetime.now(...)` which is
  accurate as a *first-seen* timestamp. The `recency_score_for_job` helper
  gates on `date_confidence="fabricated"` before consulting `date_found`,
  so the timestamp itself doesn't leak into scoring — the fabricated flag
  short-circuits to 0. Dropping the `date_found` column entirely is a
  later cleanup (see "Deferred").

## Batch 2.3 — Static skill synonym table — MERGED

**Merged:** <pending commit> on 2026-04-21

**Plan coverage:**
- Plan §4 Batch 2.3
- Report item(s): #3 (skill synonym table) + partial-#16 (ESCO activation
  deferred to Batch 2.6)

**Touches:**
- **New file** `backend/src/core/skill_synonyms.py`: +493-entry canonical-form
  dictionary covering tech (languages, frameworks, cloud, DevOps, AI/ML,
  data engineering, mobile, testing, security) and UK-professional domains
  (medical/NHS, finance, legal, HR/PM, marketing) plus general acronyms.
  Exposes `canonicalize_skill(raw) -> str` (LRU-cached),
  `aliases_for(skill) -> tuple[str, ...]` (reverse lookup for the scorer),
  and `total_entries() -> int` (test guard against silent shrinkage).
- `backend/src/services/skill_matcher.py`: +15 lines
  - imports `aliases_for`,
  - adds `_text_contains_skill(text, skill)` which searches the canonical
    form and every known alias, still word-boundary aware,
  - swaps `_text_contains` → `_text_contains_skill` in the 3 skill-matching
    loops (module-level `_skill_score` + `JobScorer._skill_score`).
- `backend/src/services/profile/keyword_generator.py`: +16 lines
  - imports `canonicalize_skill`,
  - adds `_canonicalize_skill_list(skills)` preserving first-occurrence order
    and deduplicating under canonical forms,
  - wraps the primary/secondary/tertiary skill lists in the final
    `SearchConfig(...)` constructor so skills exit the profile pipeline in
    canonical form.

**Tests added:**
- **New file** `backend/tests/test_skill_synonyms.py` (+64 tests):
  - 47 parametrized canonicalization tests (29 tech + 18 UK professional),
  - 6 normalisation-semantics tests (whitespace, empty, unknown,
    idempotence),
  - 3 `aliases_for()` reverse-lookup tests,
  - 4 skill_matcher integration tests (alias text search, word boundary,
    scoring invariance across alias vs canonical job text, profile-side
    alias),
  - 3 keyword_generator integration tests (alias dedup, unknown preservation,
    order),
  - 1 table-size floor guard.

**Tests updated:** 3 in `test_profile.py`, 4 in `test_skill_tiering.py`, and
5 in `test_linkedin_github.py` — all adjusted their string assertions from
case-preserved (`"Python"`) to canonical (`"python"`), reflecting the plan's
intent that skills exit the profile pipeline in canonical form. One
assertion also tracks an alias collapse (`"Spark"` → `"apache spark"`).

**Test delta (broad, minus `test_main` + `test_sources`):** 690p/3s → 754p/3s (+64).

**Deferred from this batch:**
- ESCO embedding scaffold activation — correctly held for Batch 2.6 per
  plan's "Out of scope".
- Embedding-based skill similarity for the long tail — Batch 2.6.
- Auto-growth of the table from usage telemetry — out of scope (no
  telemetry infrastructure yet).

**Post-merge notes:**
- Table size: 493 entries, within the plan's ~500 target. A
  `total_entries() >= 400` floor-guard test catches any future shrinkage.
- Why lower-case canonical forms and not preserve case? Because word-boundary
  regex matching is already case-insensitive via `re.IGNORECASE`; the
  canonical-form string only needs to be consistent for the dedup logic in
  `_canonicalize_skill_list` to work. Lower-case is the most forgiving
  choice for string comparison.
- The `_text_contains_skill` helper is a pure superset of `_text_contains`:
  when called with a skill that has no aliases, `aliases_for(skill)` returns
  just `(canonical_form,)` which is one regex search — identical perf to
  the legacy path. Skills WITH aliases pay O(n_aliases) regex searches per
  skill, bounded by the max alias count on any single canonical form (about
  4 for the current table).
- Behavioural visibility: a user with `"k8s"` in their CV now matches jobs
  describing `"kubernetes"` and vice versa. This is the primary user-facing
  win — more real hits per search.

## Batch 2.4 — Source routing by domain — MERGED

**Merged:** <pending commit> on 2026-04-21

**Plan coverage:**
- Plan §4 Batch 2.4
- Report item(s): #4 (domain-aware source selection)

**Touches:**
- `backend/src/sources/base.py`: +10 lines — class-level `DOMAINS: set[str] = {"general"}` default on `BaseJobSource`, with a comment explaining the filter semantics. Additive per CLAUDE.md rule #2.
- **17 source files** (one-line `DOMAINS = {...}` override each):
  - tech: `apis_free/{devitjobs,landingjobs,aijobs,hn_jobs}.py`, `other/{hackernews,nofluffjobs}.py`, `scrapers/{bcs_jobs,aijobs_global,aijobs_ai,jobtensor}.py`
  - healthcare: `feeds/{nhs_jobs,nhs_jobs_xml,biospace}.py`
  - academia: `feeds/{jobs_ac_uk,uni_jobs}.py`
  - education: `apis_free/teaching_vacancies.py`
  - education + general (apprenticeships span all trades): `apis_free/gov_apprenticeships.py`
  - climate: `scrapers/climatebase.py`
- **New file** `backend/src/services/domain_classifier.py`: +130 lines —
  `classify_user_domain(profile) -> set[str]` mapping profile titles + skills
  + LinkedIn positions + industry to the 5-domain taxonomy, plus
  `source_matches_user_domains(src_domains, user_domains) -> bool` with the
  plan's gate rules (empty user → include all; general source → include;
  overlap → include).
- `backend/src/main.py`: +12 lines —
  - import `classify_user_domain` + `source_matches_user_domains`,
  - widen `_build_sources(...)` with `user_profile=None` parameter,
  - append domain-aware filter after the existing `source_filter` short-circuit,
  - call-site in `run_search()` passes `user_profile=profile`.

**Tests added:** `backend/tests/test_domain_classifier.py` (+47 tests):
- 16 `classify_user_domain` tests across all 5 domains + multi-domain +
  general-not-emitted + word-boundary false-match + LinkedIn positions.
- 6 `source_matches_user_domains` gate tests (empty user, general short-circuit,
  healthcare/tech exclusivity, multi-tag overlap).
- 18 source-attribute assertions via `parametrize` (base default + 17
  specifically-tagged sources) + one gov_apprenticeships multi-tag test.
- 4 end-to-end `_build_sources` tests (healthcare skips tech; tech skips
  healthcare; zero-profile → all 49; `--source` filter still works).

**Test delta (broad, minus `test_main` + `test_sources`):** 754p/3s → 801p/3s (+47).

**Deferred from this batch:**
- Zero-yield tracker / per-domain auto-disable — correctly held for Batch 4
  per plan's "Out of scope". Requires engagement telemetry that hasn't
  landed.
- Per-source enable/disable UI — same.

**Post-merge notes:**
- Minimal-touch pattern: `DOMAINS` defaults to `{"general"}` on the base
  class, so only the 17 non-general sources carry an override. General
  sources (Reed, Adzuna, JSearch, Jooble, Google Jobs, Careerjet, Findwork,
  Arbeitnow, Indeed/Glassdoor, TheMuse, LinkedIn, all 11 ATS boards,
  remote-focused RSS feeds, 80000Hours) inherit silently — the filter
  still short-circuits them in.
- The plan said "Each of 50 source files — declare domain tags" but the
  "declare" semantics include inheritance of the base-class default. This
  keeps 32 source files untouched and achieves the intended behaviour.
- A generic "Project Manager" profile classifies to empty set → the
  graceful-fallback branch in `_build_sources` includes every source. This
  is intentional — we don't want to narrow down ambiguous profiles.
- `eightykhours` (80 000 Hours / effective altruism careers) stays in
  `{"general"}` because the board mixes climate/AI-safety/biosecurity/animal-
  welfare/policy roles; tagging it `"climate"` would miss tech-safety users
  and vice versa.
- Short keywords (`ai`, `pi `, `sen `) use word-boundary matching (regex
  `\b...\b`) to avoid false-matching on substrings like "maintain",
  "captain", "senior".
- All ATS boards (Greenhouse, Lever, Workable, Ashby, SmartRecruiters,
  Pinpoint, Recruitee, Workday, Personio, SuccessFactors, Rippling, Comeet)
  stay on `{"general"}` — they serve diverse companies, and the company
  slug list in `core/companies.py` is tech-leaning so non-tech users won't
  get spammed even though the sources run for them.

## Batch 2.5 — LLM job enrichment pipeline — MERGED

**Merged:** <pending commit> on 2026-04-21

**Plan coverage:**
- Plan §4 Batch 2.5
- Report item(s): #5 (highest-impact — structured job fields for dedup,
  scoring, and Batch 2.6 embeddings)

**Spike gate — IN-CI MOCKED, LIVE-FIRE DEFERRED:**
The plan mandates a Day 1 spike: enrich 100 sample jobs through the real
Gemini→Groq→Cerebras chain and confirm ≥95 % schema-valid + ≥50 % quota
headroom before proceeding. The full-batch scaffolding has landed with 24
mocked tests that prove the pipeline works end-to-end on a synthetic
`JobEnrichment`. The **operational spike on live keys remains TODO for
rollout** — it cannot run in the Ralph Loop iteration because:
1. CLAUDE.md rule #4 forbids live HTTP during `pytest`.
2. The generator session has no Gemini/Groq/Cerebras API keys configured.
Rollout steps for the operator:
1. Export `GEMINI_API_KEY` / `GROQ_API_KEY` / `CEREBRAS_API_KEY` locally.
2. Set `ENRICHMENT_ENABLED=true`.
3. Run a one-shot against 100 recent jobs (example scaffold —
   `backend/scripts/spike_enrichment.py` — left for the operator; not in
   this batch's Touches).
4. If schema-valid ≥95 % and quota headroom ≥50 %, enable the ARQ task.
5. Otherwise halt and choose between prompt tuning, model swap, or
   OpenAI Batch as the plan's fallback suggests.

**Touches:**
- **New file** `backend/src/services/job_enrichment_schema.py`: +160 lines —
  Pydantic `JobEnrichment` model with 18 fields plus 8 enum types
  (`JobCategory`, `EmploymentType`, `WorkplaceType`, `VisaSponsorship`,
  `SeniorityLevel`, `ExperienceLevel`, `EmployerType`, `SalaryFrequency`)
  and one nested model (`SalaryBand`). Every list field is length-bounded;
  currency is uppercased and language is lowercased via validators;
  duplicate list entries are collapsed.
- **New file** `backend/src/services/job_enrichment.py`: +160 lines —
  `async def enrich_job(job, llm_extract_validated_fn=...)` wrapping
  `llm_extract_validated()` from the profile module's provider chain, plus
  `has_enrichment()` / `save_enrichment()` / `load_enrichment()` DB helpers
  for the `job_enrichment` table (INSERT OR REPLACE upsert). Exposes the
  `ENRICHMENT_ENABLED` feature flag that defaults to off so pre-Batch-2.5
  behaviour is preserved exactly when not opted in.
- **New migration pair** `backend/migrations/0008_job_enrichment.{up,down}.sql` —
  `job_enrichment` table keyed by `job_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES
  jobs(id) ON DELETE CASCADE`. 18 columns + `enriched_at`. Auto-discovered
  by the existing `migrations/runner.py` (no runner changes needed).
  **No `user_id` column** per CLAUDE.md rule #10 (shared catalog).
- `backend/src/services/deduplicator.py`: +35/-5 lines — new
  `_enrichment_bonus(job, enrichments)` helper + widened `deduplicate(jobs,
  enrichments=None)` signature. When `enrichments` is provided, jobs with
  an enrichment row get a +5 tiebreaker *between* match_score and
  completeness. `enrichments=None` callers (every pre-Batch-2.5 caller)
  see zero behavioural change.
- `backend/src/workers/tasks.py`: +60 lines — new `enrich_job_task(ctx,
  job_id)` fan-out task. Reads the job from `ctx['db']`, delegates to
  `enrich_job()` with the optional `ctx['llm_extract_validated']` mock
  hook, persists via `save_enrichment()`. Idempotent: returns
  `{"enriched": False, "reason": "already_enriched"}` if the row exists.
  Swallows LLM exceptions into `reason="llm_error: …"` so ARQ's retry
  machinery doesn't double-bill quota for the same failure.

**Tests added:** `backend/tests/test_job_enrichment.py` (+24 tests):
- 9 schema validation tests (minimal-payload default fill, empty-title
  reject, bad-enum reject, negative years reject, >250 char summary reject,
  currency upper-case, location dedup, language lower-case, max-length
  required_skills).
- 3 `enrich_job()` wrapper tests (valid round-trip; prompt contains title
  + truncated description; LLM failure propagates).
- 4 DB persistence tests (save+load round-trip on full fixture, `has_enrichment`
  detects existing rows, `load_enrichment` returns None when missing,
  `save_enrichment` behaves as an upsert).
- 4 worker-task tests (happy path, idempotence calls LLM only once,
  job-not-found path, LLM-failure path does not create partial row).
- 3 deduplicator tests (enrichment bonus breaks tie, pre-Batch-2.5 callers
  see unchanged behaviour, match_score still beats enrichment).
- 1 feature-flag tolerance test.

**Test delta (broad, minus `test_main` + `test_sources`):** 801p/3s → 825p/3s (+24).

**Deferred from this batch:**
- Using enrichment fields in the scorer — Batch 2.9 (salary) + Batch 2.8
  (required/preferred skills split).
- Backfilling pre-existing jobs — a `scripts/backfill_enrichment.py`
  one-shot was named out-of-scope; defer until live-fire spike result.
- Adding OpenAI Batch as a provider — contingent on quota results post
  rollout, explicitly out-of-scope here.
- `ENRICHMENT_ENABLED=true` in CI — the flag defaults to false and no
  production code path invokes it automatically. The ARQ worker settings
  will need a follow-up to wire `enrich_job_task` into the post-ingest
  fan-out once the spike passes.

**Post-merge notes:**
- The `enrich_job()` wrapper accepts an `llm_extract_validated_fn` keyword
  precisely so tests can inject a mock without patching the real
  `llm_extract_validated` — keeps CLAUDE.md rule #4 honest.
- Schema bump caution: `JobEnrichment` is persisted via JSON dumps of its
  list/nested fields. Future schema changes that add required fields
  will break `load_enrichment` on old rows; always add new fields with
  defaults + Pydantic's `Field(default=...)` or a follow-up migration
  that backfills.
- The enrichment bonus in the dedup tiebreaker is **5**, positioned
  between `match_score` (max 100) and `_completeness` (max ~45). That
  keeps `match_score` dominant while still resolving a score tie decisively
  toward the enriched candidate.

## Batch 2.9 — Multi-dimensional scoring from enriched fields — MERGED

**Merged:** <pending commit> on 2026-04-21

**Plan coverage:**
- Plan §4 Batch 2.9
- Report item(s): #10 (salary) + #13 (7+ scoring dimensions)

**Touches:**
- **New file** `backend/src/core/fx.py`: +45 lines — 18-currency → GBP
  rate table (GBP, USD, EUR, CAD, AUD, CHF, SEK, NOK, DKK, JPY, INR, SGD,
  HKD, PLN, CZK, NZD, ZAR, AED). Unknown codes return 1.0 (safe degraded
  behaviour — better to over-include than silently drop).
- **New file** `backend/src/services/salary.py`: +85 lines —
  `normalize_salary(salary, to_annual=True, to_currency="GBP")` returning
  `(min_gbp_annual, max_gbp_annual)` or None. Frequency conversion
  (hourly×2080 / daily×260 / weekly×52 / monthly×12). Tolerates both
  Pydantic `SalaryBand` models and plain dicts (DB JSON path). Swapped
  min/max are corrected, single-point bands mirror, unknown frequency
  treated as annual.
- **New file** `backend/src/services/scoring_dimensions.py`: +165 lines —
  four scorers:
    - `seniority_score` 0..8 (full on exact match, 62 % at 1-rank delta,
      25 % at 2-rank, 0 at 3+; neutral half-weight on missing signal)
    - `salary_score` 0..10 (band-overlap divided by smaller-span; neutral
      5/10 when enrichment or user range missing — per research report)
    - `visa_score` 0..6 (only awarded when `needs_visa=True`; 0 when user
      doesn't need it; half on unknown/missing)
    - `workplace_score` 0..6 (exact match → full, hybrid-as-compromise → half,
      polar opposite → 0)
- `backend/src/core/settings.py`: +11 lines — `SALARY_WEIGHT`,
  `SENIORITY_WEIGHT`, `VISA_WEIGHT`, `WORKPLACE_WEIGHT` env-overridable
  defaults (10/8/6/6).
- `backend/src/services/profile/models.py`: +11 lines — `preferred_workplace:
  Optional[str]` + `needs_visa: bool` added to `UserPreferences` with
  safe defaults (None/False) so pre-Batch-2.9 profiles keep working.
- `backend/src/services/skill_matcher.py`: +22 lines — `JobScorer.__init__`
  widened with optional `user_preferences` + `enrichment_lookup` kwargs;
  `JobScorer.score()` adds the four new dimension bonuses when both are
  provided. Lazy import of `scoring_dimensions` inside `score()` keeps the
  import graph acyclic. Legacy call sites (no kwargs) get identical
  pre-Batch-2.9 behaviour.

**Tests added:**
- **New file** `backend/tests/test_salary.py` (+19 tests): FX identity +
  USD/EUR conversion + unknown-currency passthrough, full annual / hourly /
  daily / monthly / weekly roll-ups, single-point bands, swapped bounds,
  dict input, enum + string frequency, non-GBP / non-annual rejection.
- **New file** `backend/tests/test_scoring_dimensions.py` (+30 tests):
  each of the 4 scorers at full / partial / 0 / neutral cases, plus 3
  `JobScorer` integration tests (enriched outscores base, None-lookup
  preserves base behaviour, perfect job caps at 100).

**Test delta (broad, minus `test_main` + `test_sources`):** 825p/3s → 874p/3s (+49).

**Deferred from this batch:**
- Live FX rates — correctly held per plan ("hard-coded annual rates at
  `core/fx.py`"). Rates bank what the plan said: coarse averages, not
  payroll-grade.
- Salary history / market comparison — out of scope.
- Interview-likelihood / growth-trajectory dims (career-ops) — require
  engagement telemetry, deferred to Batch 4.
- Archetype-specific weight profiles — §9 deferred.

**Post-merge notes:**
- Opt-in integration: a legacy caller that does `JobScorer(config)` keeps
  getting the 4-component formula. Only callers that pass BOTH
  `user_preferences` and `enrichment_lookup` get the enrichment-driven
  dimensions. This preserves backward compatibility for pipeline.py,
  tests, and the CLI view.
- The final `min(max(total, 0), 100)` cap is unchanged — a "perfect" job
  can still max at 100 because base 70 (title 40 + skill 40 + loc 10 +
  recency 10 − 0 − 0) caps at 100 before dims even add, and
  dim_bonus maxes at 30 (10 + 8 + 6 + 6). With enrichment boosts the
  sum can exceed 100, but the clamp handles it.
- Test `test_jobscorer_dim_bonus_caps_at_100` explicitly verifies the
  clamp; `test_jobscorer_enrichment_lookup_returning_none_falls_back_to_base`
  proves no double-counting of dimensions when the lookup is empty.

## Batch 2.6 — Embeddings + ChromaDB + ESCO activation — MERGED

**Merged:** <pending commit> on 2026-04-21

**Plan coverage:**
- Plan §4 Batch 2.6
- Report item(s): #8 (bi-encoder semantic search) + #16 (ESCO taxonomy)

**Touches:**
- `backend/pyproject.toml`: +10 lines — new `[semantic]` extra (supersedes
  `[esco]`) that installs `sentence-transformers`, `numpy`, and `chromadb`
  in one go. `[esco]` is retained as a deprecated alias.
- **New file** `backend/src/services/embeddings.py`: +155 lines —
  `encode_job(job, enrichment, encoder_factory=...)` returns a 384-dim
  vector. CLAUDE.md rule #11 compliance: `sentence_transformers` + `numpy`
  are imported lazily inside functions. Chunking policy: when job
  description exceeds 300 words, split into 300-token windows with 50-word
  overlap and max-pool per-chunk vectors (research report's
  asymmetric-search trick). Encoder cache is module-level with
  `reset_cache_for_testing()` for tests.
- **New file** `backend/src/services/vector_index.py`: +115 lines — thin
  `VectorIndex` over a ChromaDB persistent collection at
  `backend/data/chroma/`. Methods: `upsert(job_id, vector, metadata)`,
  `query(vector, k, filter_metadata)`, `delete(job_id)`, `count()`. Tests
  inject a fake client to avoid real Chroma on pytest.
- **New migration pair** `backend/migrations/0009_job_embeddings.{up,down}.sql` —
  `job_embeddings` audit table (job_id FK, model_version, embedding_updated_at).
  No user_id (shared catalog per CLAUDE.md rule #10). Index on
  `model_version` for drift detection. Auto-discovered by the runner.
- `backend/src/core/settings.py`: +5 lines — `SEMANTIC_ENABLED` env flag.
- `backend/src/services/profile/skill_normalizer.py`: +12 lines —
  `is_available()` helper so downstream callers (Batch 2.6 + 2.7) degrade
  gracefully when the ESCO artefacts are missing. (The existing `_ESCOIndex`
  class already handles the missing-index case via its `.available` flag.)
- **New script** `scripts/build_job_embeddings.py`: +95 lines — one-shot
  backfill that walks rows in `job_enrichment` missing a matching
  `job_embeddings` entry (for the current `MODEL_NAME`), encodes each via
  `encode_job()`, and upserts to ChromaDB. Idempotent: re-running skips
  already-embedded jobs.

**Tests added:**
- **New file** `backend/tests/test_embeddings.py` (+15 tests):
  `_chunk_words` + `_pool_chunk_vectors` helpers, `encode_job`
  determinism, chunk-triggering on long descriptions, degraded no-enrichment
  mode, empty-title fallback, `VectorIndex` upsert/query/delete/count with a
  fake client (deterministic toy distance).
- **New file** `backend/tests/test_skill_normalizer_activation.py` (+6 tests):
  `is_available()` contract (absent / partial / empty-dir / reset), ops
  `index_status()` reflects data_dir, `SEMANTIC_ENABLED` flag is boolean.

**Test delta (broad, minus `test_main` + `test_sources`):** 874p/3s → 895p/3s (+21).

**Deferred from this batch:**
- Live-fire ESCO index build — the `scripts/build_esco_index.py` already
  exists from Pillar 1; the operator runs it after `pip install '.[semantic]'`.
- First-time job-embedding backfill — the `scripts/build_job_embeddings.py`
  script is provided; gated behind `SEMANTIC_ENABLED=true` at the CLI.
- Real ChromaDB persistence testing — held behind the mocked client since
  pytest must stay fast and offline.
- Fallback to FAISS — explicitly out-of-scope; stop condition #4 in the
  generator prompt says escalate to reviewer if Chroma flakes in CI.

**Post-merge notes:**
- CLAUDE.md rule #11 literally targets `apprise`; the same principle
  (~30 MB of heavy deps) applies to `sentence_transformers` (~300 MB) and
  `chromadb` (~30 MB + dependencies). Both are imported lazily inside the
  functions that use them. Neither appears at module top. Tests never
  trigger a real import — they inject `encoder_factory` / `client=...`.
- The 300-word chunking threshold uses word splits rather than proper
  token splits to avoid shipping a dedicated tokenizer in library code —
  this is a conservative approximation (English words average ≈1.3 tokens
  in the MiniLM vocab so 300 words ≈ 400 tokens; good enough for the
  short-query/long-document asymmetry the report flags).
- Chunking path activates on `job.description`, not on the 250-char
  `requirements_summary` — a reconciliation of the plan's two slightly
  inconsistent mentions of the source field. Summary is always short,
  description is where the long tail lives, and that's where chunking
  actually pays off.
- Vector dimensions are stored as plain Python `list[float]` in the
  `encode_job` return value so downstream code doesn't need numpy to
  persist. ChromaDB accepts plain lists.

## Batch 2.7 — Hybrid retrieval with Reciprocal Rank Fusion — MERGED

**Merged:** <pending commit> on 2026-04-21

**Plan coverage:**
- Plan §4 Batch 2.7
- Report item(s): #9 (RRF k=60)

**Touches:**
- **New file** `backend/src/services/retrieval.py`: +120 lines —
  - `reciprocal_rank_fusion(ranked_lists, k=60)` pure helper, stable-sorted
    on first-appearance tiebreaker, raises on non-positive k.
  - `retrieve_for_user(profile, k=100, keyword_fn=..., semantic_fn=..., rrf_k=60)`
    orchestrator. Keyword_fn is required; semantic_fn is optional. When
    semantic returns empty OR raises, the function silently degrades to
    keyword-only. Empty keyword results return `[]` (no point fusing with
    nothing).
  - `is_hybrid_available(vector_index_count)` gate used by the API route to
    choose between hybrid and keyword-only default.
- `backend/src/api/routes/jobs.py`: +6 lines — added an optional
  `mode: Optional[str] = Query(None)` parameter to `/jobs`. The param is
  reserved (noted with `_ = mode`) pending wiring of `retrieve_for_user` into
  the route body once SEMANTIC_ENABLED=true + ChromaDB backfill ships. The
  route keeps its existing keyword behaviour untouched so pre-Batch-2.7
  callers see zero change.

**Tests added:** `backend/tests/test_retrieval.py` (+17 tests):
- 7 RRF tests (single-list passthrough, two-list fusion with common item,
  rank-position monotonicity, empty input, k-smoothing intuition,
  determinism, non-positive k rejection).
- 7 `retrieve_for_user` tests (missing keyword_fn, keyword-only default,
  empty keyword early-return, fused when both available, semantic-empty
  fallback, semantic-raise fallback, k respected).
- 3 `is_hybrid_available` gate tests (positive count, zero, defensive
  negative handling).

**Test delta (broad, minus `test_main` + `test_sources`):** 895p/3s → 912p/3s (+17).

**Deferred from this batch:**
- Wiring `retrieve_for_user` into `/jobs` route body — the route accepts
  the `mode` param but doesn't act on it yet. Needs the route to receive
  a `VectorIndex` dependency + a `user_profile` loader; keeping this
  minimal avoids coupling hybrid rollout to the semantic stack being
  fully populated. Follow-up issue.
- LTR / personalised ranking — correctly held per plan's "Out of scope".
- Query-time embedding cache — a future optimisation when
  `retrieve_for_user` is called tight loops. Not measurable yet.

**Post-merge notes:**
- RRF `k=60` is the Cormack 2009 default. Smaller k makes rank position
  matter more sharply; larger k flattens the contribution curve. The plan
  fixes the constant at 60 per the research report's recommendation.
- Stable tiebreaker: when two items score identically (e.g. both
  appeared once at the same rank), the one that appeared in the
  `ranked_lists` iterable first wins — this is important for
  reproducibility in snapshot-style tests.
- The orchestrator is **synchronous** and accepts injected fetchers
  because the two signal paths (SQL + Chroma) have very different async
  lifetimes, and testing both async-orchestrating paths without proxies
  is painful. Real callers (FastAPI route / ARQ worker) do the async
  glue and hand the orchestrator plain lists.
